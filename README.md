QUESTION PART 1
Title: 	Exploring Array and Functions Operations in C++
Objective:	Write a C++ program capable of executing all the necessary features’ as listed below, utilizing arrays and functions. Users have the option to choose which function’s output to view.
Program Features:	
1.	Array Declaration and Initialization:
	Declare an integer array named `numbers` with a size of 5.
	Initialize the array with values {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.

2.	Array Traversal:
	Write a function `displayArray` that takes an array and its size as parameters and prints each element of the array.
	Use this function to display the contents of the `numbers` array.

3.	Array Modification:
	Write a function `modifyArray` that takes an array and its size as parameters.
	In the function, prompt the user to enter a new value for each element of the array.
	Update the array with the new values.
	Display the modified array using the `displayArray` function.

4.	Array Summation:
	Write a function `sumArray` that takes an array and its size as parameters and returns the sum of all elements in the array.
	Use this function to find and display the sum of elements in the `numbers` array.

5.	Array Searching:
	Write a function `searchArray` that takes an array, its size, and a value to search as parameters.
	The function should return the index of the first occurrence of the value in the array. If not found, return an error notification to the user.
	Use this function to search for a user-input value in the `numbers` array and display the result.

6.	Array Sorting:
	Implement a function `sortArray` that takes an array and its size as parameters and sorts the elements in ascending order.
	Display the sorted array using the `displayArray` function.


7.	Additional Challenge:
	Implement a function to find the maximum and minimum values in the array.
	Display the maximum and minimum values.
Constraints	Only employ the specified C++ constructs:

	Screen input and output, including formatting
	Arithmetic operations for calculations
	Selection in control flow
	Repetition in control flow
	One-dimensional array, multi-dimensional array or Vector
	Functions
	Pointers
Submission		Submit a single C++ source file (.cpp) containing the complete program.
	Include comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each function.
	Test your program with different inputs and provide sample outputs in comments.
